🛳️ Titanic Survival Analysis
📘 Project Description

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset.
The goal is to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival, such as:

Gender

Passenger class

Age

Embarkation point

Fare

We use visualizations to represent survival patterns clearly and simply.

📊 Dataset

Dataset: Titanic Dataset - Kaggle

The dataset contains details about passengers such as:

Name

Age

Gender

Ticket class

Fare

Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🧰 Tools & Libraries

This project uses the following Python libraries:

Pandas → Data cleaning and analysis

Matplotlib → Plotting and visualizations

Seaborn → Advanced and beautiful charts

⚙️ Steps Performed

Import Libraries
Loaded Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Load Dataset
Imported the Titanic dataset (CSV file).

Data Exploration

Checked for missing values

Viewed dataset summary and structure

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in “Age” and “Embarked”

Converted categorical data (like gender) into numerical form if needed

Data Visualization
Created visualizations such as:

Overall survival count

Survival by gender

Survival by passenger class

Survival by age groups

Correlation heatmap

Key Findings

Females had a higher survival rate.

First-class passengers survived more than lower classes.

Younger passengers had better survival chances.

📈 Example Visuals

💡 Conclusion

The analysis shows that gender, class, and age played major roles in determining survival on the Titanic.
This project demonstrates how data visualization helps uncover meaningful insights from real-world datasets.
